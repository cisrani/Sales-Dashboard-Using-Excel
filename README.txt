Creating personal project using Microsoft Excel 
"Electronic Sales Dashboard"

I use dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/knightbearr/sales-product-data
I also upload the dataset in this repository . Dataset : Sales_September_2019.csv
Steps what i did to make sales dashboard:
1. Data cleaning because the data have many blank cells and duplicate data
2. I change text to column in feature "Purchase Address"
3. I add "Sales" column which have value Quantity Ordered * Price Each
4. Make pivot tables
5. Make pivot charts
6. Put in to dashboard

Result : Sales Dashbord2.xlsx
